# React Hook

The `usePopper` hook provides an API almost identical to the ones of
[`createPopper`](../../../docs/v2/constructors/#createpopper) constructor.

Rather than returning a Popper instance, it will return an object containing the
following properties:

<x-ad />

### `styles`

The `styles` property is an object, its properties are `popper`, and `arrow`.
The two properties are a
[`CSSStyleDeclaration` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleDeclaration)
describing the necessary CSS properties needed to properly position the two
elements.

You can directly assign the value of the two properties to the React `style`
property of your components.

```jsx
<div style={styles.popper} />
```

### `attributes`

Similar to `styles`, the `attributes` object lists the `popper` and `arrow` HTML
attributes, by default, only `popper` will hold some attributes (e.g.
`data-popper-placement`), but more generically, any HTML attribute described by
the Popper documentation will be available inside these properties.

The easiest way to consume their values is by destructuring them directly onto
your React component.

```jsx
<div {...attributes.popper} />
```

### `update`, `forceUpdate`, and `state`

These properties match the ones described in the
[Popper docs](../../docs/v2/constructors/#types), the only difference is that
they can be `null` if Popper isn't yet been initialized or has been destroyed.
