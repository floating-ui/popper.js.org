# Event Listeners

The `eventListeners` modifier adds `scroll` and `resize` listeners that update
the position of the popper when necessary. These are not exhaustive and don't
cover the following cases:

## When the reference element moves or changes size

Most of the times, you can avoid the need to reposition your popper when its
reference element moves on the page by attaching the popper DOM node right next
to the reference DOM node.

This has the advantage of dramatically reducing the amount of updates required
to keep the popper and reference elements next to each other, but has some quirks
to keep in mind.

First of all, you must make sure the parent elements are not clipping containers.
A clipping container is an element with the ability to clip (or hide) content that
overflows its boundaries.  
A common misconception is that any parent with `overflow: hidden` will clip any
overflowing child element, but that's not actually the case.  
An element, in order to gain such characteristics, needs to have an `overflow`
property set to `auto`, `scroll`, `overlay`, or `hidden`, and needs to act as
[offset parent](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-htmlelement-offsetparent)
or be parent of an offset parent. Only in these conditions, a popper will get cut
off when it overflows its parent.

Note that Popper already handles this case, and will only attempt to make the
popper not overflow its parent if the parent is a clipping container.

## When the popper element changes size (i.e. content)

This case is not handled by the `eventListeners` modifier because it's already
handled by the `computeStyles` one, when its [`adaptive`](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/compute-styles/#adaptive)
property is enabled (on by default).

## Other cases

For any other cases not included in the options above, you may want to either
update the instance via `instance.update()`, a `ResizeObserver` or
`requestAnimationFrame` loop (if animating) to solve these if necessary.


## Phase
