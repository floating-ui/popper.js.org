# Documentation

Popper is a low-level, pure, and functional positioning engine for "poppers" —
floating elements which are positioned relative to another element (such as
tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and more).

Its sole goal is to correctly position your floating element next to a given
reference (or target) element. It has no opinions on how those elements function
regarding their behavior. Positioning these elements correctly in any scenario
is the difficult part, which is the focus of this library!

- **Platform-agnostic:** runs anywhere JavaScript does: the web, React Native,
  etc.
- **Unopinionated:** Popper employs an inversion-of-control API, leaving the
  application of styles up to you. It only calculates the necessary coordinates
  and provides useful data for you to use.
- **Highly extensible:** modify the positioning coordinates or add any data via
  modifiers.
- **Tree-shakeable:** tiny 600B core with a highly modular architecture, keeping
  your JavaScript bundles small.
- **Gradual adoption:** Add features as you need them, no unexpected or
  hard-to-configure positioning logic.

## Why not use pure CSS?

So, why do we need a fancy "positioning engine" to position floating elements
like tooltips and popovers?

We recommend you visit the [tutorial](./tutorial) which teaches a practical
example of why JavaScript positioning offers several advantages over CSS and is
necessary in reusable component libraries.
