# Performance

## Subpixel positioning

Instead of using `top` and `left` properties, we can use `transform` to position
the popper on the subpixel grid (e.g. high PPI displays), which also improves
update performance by placing the popper on its own GPU-accelerated layer.

```js
computePosition(reference, popper).then(({ x, y }) => {
  Object.assign(popper.style, {
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    // 3D transforms are only recommended for high PPI displays, as they can
    // disable subpixel antialiasing, resulting in blurring.
    transform: `translate3d(${x}px,${y}px,0)`,
  });
});
```

If you're transitioning the location of the popper on the screen, this also
results in smoother animations.

## Reducing repositioning needed

By placing the popper element inside the same scrolling context as the reference
element, when using the `absolute` strategy, you'll reduce how often the
popper's position will need to be updated.

```html
<div class="scroll">
  <div>Reference</div>
  <div>Popper</div>
</div>
```

If your popper is not within a fixed container, but the reference element is,
you should use the `fixed` strategy:

```js
computePosition(reference, popper, { strategy: 'fixed' });
```

This will reduce stutters or jitters in browsers due to their async behavior.
