# hide

The `hide` modifier provides data to hide the popper element during certain
scenarios where applicable, such as when the popper is not within the same
clipping context as the reference.

<Hide />

Scroll the container.

The popper turns partially transparent when it escapes the reference's clipping
boundary. It then turns invisible when the reference is hidden.

## Usage

```js
import { computePosition, hide } from '@popperjs/dom';

computePosition(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [hide()],
});
```

## Data

The `hide` modifier passes data inside `modifiersData.hide` for the consumer:

```flow
type Data = {
  isReferenceHidden: boolean,
  hasPopperEscaped: boolean,
  referenceClippingOffsets: SideObject,
  popperEscapeOffsets: SideObject,
};
```

### `isReferenceHidden`

Determines whether the reference element is currently not visible on screen for
the user.

### `hasPopperEscaped`

Determines whether the popper element has "escaped" the reference's clipping
context and appears fully detached from it.

### `referenceClippingOffsets`

A side object containing overflow offsets.

### `popperEscapeOffsets`

A side object containing overflow offsets.
