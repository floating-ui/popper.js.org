# arrow

The `arrow` modifier provides data to position an inner element of the popper
element, usually the triangle or caret that points toward the reference element,
so that it is pointing toward its center at all times.

<Arrow />

## Usage

```js
import { computePosition, arrow } from '@popperjs/dom';

computePosition(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [arrow({ element: arrow })],
});
```

## Options

`arrow()` takes an object of options:

```flow
type Options = {
  element: HTMLElement,
  padding: number | SideObject,
};
```

### `element`

The arrow element that is to be positioned.

```js
arrow({
  element: document.querySelector('#arrow'),
});
```

### `padding`

Padding between the edges of the popper element; useful if the popper has curved
corners using `border-radius`.

```js
arrow({
  padding: 5, // 5px from the edges of the popper
});
```

## Data

The `arrow` modifier passes data inside `modifiersData.arrow` for the consumer:

```flow
type Data = {
  x?: number,
  y?: number,
  centerOffset: number,
};
```

### `x`

This property exists in the data object if the `x` axis has offset.

### `y`

This property exists in the data object if the `y` axis has offset.

### `centerOffset`

This property describes the offset of the arrow (where it actually is) relative
to where it _could_ be if it were allowed to overflow the popper element in
order to be centered to the reference element.

This enables two useful things:

- It allows you to hide the arrow if it can no longer be centered to the
  reference element, i.e. `centerOffset` is non-zero.
- It allows you to alter the shape of the arrow to point toward the reference
  element as best as it can by skewing the triangle shape.
